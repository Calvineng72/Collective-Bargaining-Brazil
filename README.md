## Project Details
The following project seeks to analyze collective bargaining agreements to determine what makes a document gain the approval of both negotiating parties. Using a corpus of CBAs derived from Brazil in the years 2008-2017, the project uses text analysis techniques, such as TFIDF, dependency parsing, and word-embeddings, alongside OLS and logistic regressions to determine what correlates with the approval of collective bargaining agreements. The paper analyzes clause counts, word-choice, and authority as independent variables, seeking to find evidence for correlations with approval. For the corpus used in the research, please contact me at calvin_eng@brown.edu, as the documents are too large to be added to GitHub in their form. 
## Research Question
What variables that can be extracted from collective bargaining agreements are correlated to their approval?
## Data
The data is derived from a collection of CBAs from Brazil from 2008-2017. The agreements contain information such as the employer, the union, the number of union representatives, whether the document is valid, whether it has been amended, the date negotiated, the date the agreement takes effect, and a variety of clauses on topics like minimum wage, overtime pay, hazard pay, night pay, seniority pay, childcare assistance, maternity assistance, hiring rules, female workforce, vocational training, equal opportunity, etc. Only documents containing more than three clauses and negotiated between firms and their employees are considered. 
## Method
For text analysis, the project uses lemmatization, TFIDF, word-embeddings, and dependency parsing, while most analysis is done with OLS regressions. 
## Results
To be included in the final draft of the project.
